Kubernetes Testing
==================

Kubernetes has been released for 7 years, surely it's ready for prime time?

FAQ
---

* *Why is there a Makefile?*  Because I wanted to build the Docker image outside the Gradle build.  Grumpy sysadmin 
   habits die hard. 
* *Does this app do anything?*  Not really.  I'm just kicking the tyres on K8S deployment using my own app.
